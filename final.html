			<p id="with-element">Despite the celebration of the Americans with Disabilities Act’s 32nd anniversary this summer, communities of people with disabilities are still fighting for progress across the U.S. This monumental piece of legislation, colloquially referred to as the ADA, set unprecedented standards for public and private services alike in their treatment of and access for people with disabilities. <a href="https://www.ada.gov/law-and-regs/design-standards/2010-stds/#top">In 2010, the ADA was updated to include recreational facilities in its scope.</a> This update contributed to a growing list of factors pushing for change across Seattle: a disability lawsuit against the Department of Transportation called Reynoldson, et al. v. City of Seattle, the growing advocacy of disability rights groups across Seattle for  <a href="https://www.disabilityrightswa.org/priorities/">increased compliance,</a> and a 2007 audit on the park's system from the DOJ. 
			<p>“The U.S. Department of Justice visited the city of Seattle around 2007, 2008 and gave us a very skinny, detailed list of locations to work on. And so that was kind of a little bit the wake up call,” Mike Schwindeller, the acting deputy director of planning and development at the Seattle Parks and Recreation Department, said. This catalyzed a realization across the City of Seattle, according to Schwindeller.</p>
			<p>The realization echoed throughout the city, causing departments in the public sector to take action. The Parks and Recreation Department set the stage for an audit across the whole parks system to analyze compliance and need in 2017. Need was determined by a list of criteria established by the department: the resulting impact the increased accessibility would have at a certain site, the amount of program offerings at the site, the site's number of visits per year, representation of underserved populations, and the date of the site's last construction. Schwindeller shared that parks have not been the department’s top priority in their transition plan.</p>
			<p>“The emphasis of the program that I've been managing, was really to prioritize these facilities that I mentioned, the community centers and pools that have our most programming,” Schwindeller said.</p>
			<p>In a city with a budget of $7.4 billion, the parks department has only recently increased their funding to $3 million a year. The National Parks and Recreation Association reported in 2021 that the average department’s annual budget is close to $4.8 million. Despite Seattle’s committed efforts over the last five years, the updating of parks and public data services have fallen behind. This article analyzes data released onto the city of Seattle's Open Data Portal in 2019, yet Schwindeller said that it has since become out of date. A new comprehensive dataset has not yet been released to the public.</p>
			<p>“Because you reached out, I am investigating. And I think that there's an opportunity to ensure that the data that's out there is the most current data, if it is somewhat out of date, that we are sort of returning to keeping it up to date,” Schwindeller said.</p>

			<h3>Accessibility and Equity in Parks</h3>
			<p>The previously mentioned 2019 dataset categorized Seattle Parks by feature. The most striking part of the dataset were the features that were labeled ADA compliant. The dataset listed four features that are required to meet the ADA’s standards: play areas, picnic sites, paths, and restrooms. Although these were the only four features listed for compliance, the ADA covers other accessible features such as “parking areas, restroom amenities, furnishings, benches, tables, drinking fountains, fishing piers, playground equipment, grills,” according to  <a href="https://www.msa-ps.com/ada-audits-for-park-and-recreational-facilities/"> MSA Professional Services.</a> Another important feature emphasized by Schwindeller is parking. </p>

			<p>“When we're going through the exercise of prioritization related to accessibility, one of the things that we did was try and put a bigger onus on our medium and larger size parks over our over majority of our pocket parks, because most pocket parks don't have designated accessible parking,” Schwindeller said.</p>

			<p>Despite these flaws in the dataset, it was still useful in creating a map of public parks in Seattle, which identifies the number of features within each park. The map also shows the borders of identified equitable areas in the city of Seattle. These areas are determined by three factors: limited English proficiency, high concentration of people of color, and low income levels. The map shows some flaws in the structural design of the parks system, as the parks in equitable areas are noticeably less compliant with ADA guidelines. The parks that have the most ADA compliant features from the dataset are located outside of these equitable areas. Only ¼ of parks with 3 ADA compliant features are located in equitable areas.</p>
			<p>If the parks department keeps focusing on the areas with the largest amount of programming, smaller parks in equitable areas will keep getting neglected and those with the least amount of resources will become even more disadvantaged. The neighborhoods in which the inequalities are most apparent are Georgetown, the University District, Northgate, and Greenwood. The city of Seattle, like many other cities in the U.S., has a long history of redlining, a practice that disadvantaged minorities in a sustained effort to preserve the whiteness of communities. The picture below shows a 1936 map of Seattle separated into blocks of the city determined by perceived “safety”. The areas labeled to be most dangerous also reflect areas with large minority populations, such as Central Seattle and Georgetown. These redlining policies left behind a long-lasting legacy that impacted the distribution of resources even in the Parks and Recreation Department. Although Central Seattle has a fair number of parks including ones whose features are ADA compliant, there aren’t nearly as many ADA compliant parks in Georgetown and extending into Beacon Hill, two communities with  <a href="https://depts.washington.edu/civilr/maps_race_seattle.htm"> very large POC populations.<a/></p>

			<h3>Uneven Compliance</h3>
			<p id="with-element">As mentioned before, the parks department has neglected updating parks to meet the 2010 ADA standards due to the prioritization of community centers and other facilities monitored by the department with higher levels of traffic. Play area is overwhelmingly the feature most compliant with the ADA's standards, yet still 21% of play areas are inaccessible. At the time this data was collected, the entire city of Seattle only had 19 play areas that met the ADA's standards. The chart below provides the criteria that must be met by a play area to be considered as compliant.</p>
			<div id="list">
				<h4>How is ADA Compliance determined for a play area?</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Accessible routes</li>
					<li>Elevation widths</li>
					<li>Water play components</li>
					<li>Ramp slopes and handrails</li>
					<li>Ground surfaces</li>

			<h3>What the future holds</h3>
			<p>Moving forward, the parks department plans envisions a more comprehensive vision of accessibility. Schwindeller plans to create a dataset with additional feature classes, expanding on how parks are classified as compliant within a dataset and adding additional facilities besides parks into one dataset. A more comprehensive dataset may explain the missing data gaps and provide explanations for low compliance in parks, but this dataset revealed the areas where Seattle needs to focus more of its resources and energy. The department has already completed over 25% of the initial barriers to accessibility identified in 2017, creating promise that they will continue to work towards full accessibility in every facility.</p>
			<p>"We have a way more complete picture than we did just 10 years ago," Schwindeller said.</p>
			<p>Yet the path to the future will still be tough to navigate. Despite the recent increase and funding and renewed committment to a transition plan, Schwindeller expects progress to slow slightly.</p>
 			<p>"A lot of the barriers ahead of us are way more decentralized," Schwindeller said.</p>
 			<p>As the department begins to tackle smaller facilities and parks with smaller concentrations of citations, their efforts will need to disperse throughout the city and not just to the areas with the most usage. Despite this, Schwindeller remains optimistic about their progress.</p>
 			<p>"We've come a long way in a fairly short amount of time, and we're just gonna keep plugging away," Schwindeller said.</p>
